# damagejs

damagejs is a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition damage calculator. It can be used to calculate damage per round (DPR) for a specified set of attack actions, given the corresponding damage dice and hit modifiers.

The underlying math is based on [LudicSavant and AureusFulgen's Comprhensive DPR Calculator](https://forums.giantitp.com/showthread.php?582779-Comprehensive-DPR-Calculator-(v2-0)). I made this adaptation in order to teach myself javascript!

Right now it's just a backend. My intent is to add a front end with React for input selection and plotting. See tests/dpr.int.

## Features still in work
* The frontend!
* Bonus/penalty dice for attack rolls and saving throws
* Feats, including class features, fighting styles, etc
* Saving throw attacks
* Resistance and Vulnerability
* Differences in advantage/disadvantage between attacks
* Technicalities with cantrips like green flame blade and multiple attacks
