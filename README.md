# damagejs

damagejs is a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition damage calculator. It can be used to calculate damage per round (DPR) for a specified set of attack actions, given the corresponding damage dice and hit modifiers.

The underlying math is based on [LudicSavant and AureusFulgen's Comprhensive DPR Calculator](https://forums.giantitp.com/showthread.php?582779-Comprehensive-DPR-Calculator-(v2-0)). I made this adaptation in order to teach myself javascript!
